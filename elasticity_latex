Here's the LaTeX version of the Elasticity formula:

\[
\text{Elasticity} = \frac{\%\Delta \text{Service Payments}}{\%\Delta \text{Customers}}
\]

This expresses the percentage change in service payments divided by the percentage change in customers, which quantifies how responsive your costs are to your growth.

If you're writing a report or paper and want inline math, use:

$\text{Elasticity} = \frac{\%\Delta \text{Service Payments}}{\%\Delta \text{Customers}}$
