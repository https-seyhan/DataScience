📐 The Logarithmic Formula

Benford’s Law says the probability that the first digit is d (where d is 1 through 9) is:
P(d)=log⁡10(1+1d)
P(d)=log10​(1+d1​)
✅ Example:

To find the probability that the first digit is 1:
P(1)=log⁡10(1+11)=log⁡10(2)≈0.301
P(1)=log10​(1+11​)=log10​(2)≈0.301

Similarly, for 2:
P(2)=log⁡10(1+12)=log⁡10(1.5)≈0.176
P(2)=log10​(1+21​)=log10​(1.5)≈0.176

This is how we get the full expected distribution.
🔍 Why the Logarithm?

Imagine numbers growing exponentially over time, like:
10,20,30,40,...,100,200,...
10,20,30,40,...,100,200,...

The space between 1 and 2 (from 1 to just under 2) on a logarithmic scale is wider than the space from 8 to 9.

In base-10 log scale:

    From 1 to 2 covers log10(2) = 0.301

    From 2 to 3 covers log10(3) - log10(2) ≈ 0.124

    From 9 to 10 covers log10(10) - log10(9) = 1 - 0.954 = 0.046

This means more numbers start with 1 than 2, more with 2 than 3, and so on.
📊 Visual Explanation

Here’s what it looks like on a logarithmic scale (conceptually):

|----------|----------------|-------------|----------|--------|------|-----|----|---|
1          2                3             4          5        6      7     8   9   10

Notice how the interval from 1–2 is widest; it shrinks as digits get higher.
📈 Plotting Benford's Law

You can visualize the expected distribution like this:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

digits = np.arange(1, 10)
probs = np.log10(1 + 1 / digits)

plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
plt.bar(digits, probs, color='teal')
plt.xticks(digits)
plt.xlabel('Leading Digit')
plt.ylabel('Probability')
plt.title("Benford's Law Distribution")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

🤔 Why Is This Useful?

Benford’s Law appears in natural systems and financial systems where:

    There's a mix of small and large numbers.

    No artificial caps or minimums.

    Data grows multiplicatively or exponentially (e.g., populations, investments, prices).

But it won’t appear:

    When all values are constrained (e.g., human height)

    In uniform or fabricated data

🚨 Fraud Detection Example

Say a company reports these first digits in expenses:
Digit	Count
1	5
2	5
3	5
...	...
9	5

This looks too uniform, which deviates strongly from Benford’s Law and could indicate manipulation.
