    Cosine similarity measures the angle (direction) between vectors, not their magnitude.

🔍 Why A and B Have High Cosine Similarity

Let’s look at simplified versions of their feature vectors:

    A: [100, 200000, 50, 500]

    B: [200, 400000, 100, 1000]

Notice that B is exactly 2× A in every component. So they lie on the same line in 4D space.
🧠 Cosine Similarity Math

The cosine similarity between two vectors A and B is:
cos⁡(θ)=A⃗⋅B⃗∥A⃗∥⋅∥B⃗∥
cos(θ)=∥A
∥⋅∥B
∥A
⋅B
​

If B⃗=2⋅A⃗B
=2⋅A

, then:

    Dot product: A⃗⋅B⃗=A⃗⋅(2A⃗)=2∥A⃗∥2A

⋅B
=A
⋅(2A
)=2∥A

∥2

Magnitudes: ∥B⃗∥=2∥A⃗∥∥B
∥=2∥A

    ∥

So:
cos⁡(θ)=2∥A⃗∥2∥A⃗∥⋅2∥A⃗∥=1
cos(θ)=∥A
∥⋅2∥A
∥2∥A
∥2​=1

That means A and B are perfectly aligned (angle = 0°), so cosine similarity = 1.
⚖️ Why This Is Useful

Even though A and B differ in scale (size), their structure or proportion is the same. This makes cosine similarity ideal for comparing:

    Organizations of different sizes

    Customers with different total purchases

    Documents of different lengths
