Network analysis can be applied to both categorical and numerical variables, but the methods and interpretations differ depending on the data type. Below is a breakdown of how to perform network analysis with both types:
🔹 1. Overview of Network Analysis

Network analysis involves representing data as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), often used to analyze patterns, relationships, and structure.
🔸 2. Categorical Variables in Network Analysis
✅ Use Case:

Understanding co-occurrence, similarity, or transitions between categories.
🧠 Approaches:
a. Co-occurrence Networks

    Nodes: Categories (e.g., types of products, job titles).

    Edges: How often two categories occur together (e.g., in the same record).

    Weight: Frequency or strength of co-occurrence.

Example: If a person selects “Action” and “Comedy” movie genres often, these genres are connected in a co-occurrence network.
b. Transition Networks (Markov Chains)

    Useful when categorical variables represent sequences (e.g., web clicks, career stages).

    Edges represent transitions from one category to another.

c. Bipartite Networks

    Two types of nodes: e.g., people and hobbies.

    Edges connect entities of different types.

🔸 3. Numerical Variables in Network Analysis
✅ Use Case:

Analyzing similarity or distance between observations based on numerical features.
🧠 Approaches:
a. Correlation Networks

    Nodes: Numerical variables.

    Edges: Correlation coefficients between variables (Pearson, Spearman).

    Often thresholded to remove weak correlations.

b. Distance-based Similarity Networks

    Nodes: Observations (e.g., users, cities).

    Edges: Similarity or distance (e.g., Euclidean, cosine).

    Often used in clustering, recommendation, or anomaly detection.

c. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Graph

    Build graph by connecting each node to its k most similar nodes.

    Used in graph-based semi-supervised learning or community detection.

🔸 4. Mixed Data (Categorical + Numerical)

When you have both types:
🧰 Approaches:
a. Gower Distance

    Handles mixed types.

    Can be used to compute pairwise similarity and construct similarity networks.

b. Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) + Clustering

    Reduce dimensionality and then cluster/group nodes for visualization.

c. Node Attributes

    Use categorical and numerical variables as attributes of nodes in a graph (e.g., user has age [numerical] and gender [categorical]).

🔸 5. Tools for Network Analysis

    Python: NetworkX, igraph, pyvis, scikit-network

    R: igraph, ggraph, tidygraph

    Visualization: Gephi, Cytoscape, D3.js

🔹 6. Example Workflow

    Prepare data (cleaning, encoding for categories).

    Compute relationships:

        Co-occurrence for categorical.

        Correlation/similarity for numerical.

        Gower for mixed.

    Build network (define nodes/edges).

    Analyze (centrality, clustering, communities).

    Visualize (force-directed layouts, node coloring by attribute).
