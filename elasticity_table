📊 Elasticity Interpretation Table
Elasticity Value	Interpretation	Actionable Insight
> 1	Highly elastic: Costs are rising faster than customer growth	Growth is costly → investigate scalability issues
≈ 1	Proportional: Costs and customers are growing in sync	Balanced scaling
0 < Elasticity < 1	Inelastic: Costs growing slower than customers	Efficient growth
0	No change in cost despite customer growth	Extremely efficient (or flat rate cost)
< 0	Inverse: Cost and customer growth move in opposite directions	Red flag: investigate anomalies or inefficiencies
🔍 Special Cases
Condition	Example	Meaning
Both % changes are negative	Customers ↓10%, Payments ↓8%	Positive elasticity → shrinking, but in sync
Customers ↑, Payments ↓	Customers ↑10%, Payments ↓5%	Negative elasticity → improving efficiency
Customers ↓, Payments ↑	Customers ↓10%, Payments ↑5%	Negative elasticity → dangerous inefficiency
Elasticity spikes suddenly	Any	Potential anomaly → root cause analysis recommended
