Business-Style Summary: Growth Efficiency Analysis
Overview:

This weekly analysis evaluates whether your company's customer growth and service payments are scaling in a healthy, efficient way.
🔍 Key Findings (Weeks 1–5):
Metric	Observation
Customer Growth	Grew steadily at ~20% weekly (Week 2–4).
Service Payments	Increased more rapidly than customer growth.
Cost per Customer	Rose from $10 → $13, suggesting rising costs.
Elasticity	Consistently >1.0 (e.g., 1.94 in Week 5), indicating that costs are growing faster than customers.
🚨 Interpretation:

    The cost per customer is increasing as the customer base grows.

    The elasticity of service cost (how responsive payments are to customer growth) is consistently above 1.0 — a warning sign of inefficient scaling.

    By Week 5, the system is likely under operational pressure, requiring more spending per customer.

📌 Recommendations:

    Audit your support processes: Are more staff or tools needed, or are current processes inefficient?

    Segment support demand: Identify if new customers require more attention (e.g., onboarding load).

    Target Elasticity < 1: Aim to bring down cost growth relative to customer growth.

    Monitor Customer Satisfaction (e.g., NPS) to ensure service quality isn't falling despite higher spending.
