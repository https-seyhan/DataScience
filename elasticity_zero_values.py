Here's the updated table with elasticity correctly handled â€” especially when the customer growth is zero, which makes elasticity undefined (we safely replaced it with 0.0 for clustering):
Week	Customers	Service Payments	Customer Growth %	Payment Growth %	Elasticity
1	1000	10,000	0.00	0.00	0.00
2	1200	13,200	20.00	32.00	1.60
3	1440	16,500	20.00	25.00	1.25
4	1728	20,700	20.00	25.45	1.27
5	1900	24,700	9.95	19.32	1.94
ðŸ“Œ Observations:

    Week 1 has no change â†’ elasticity = 0

    Weeks 2â€“5 have elasticity > 1, meaning service costs are growing faster than customer count â€” a sign of expensive scaling.
