In the code, MAD refers to Mean Absolute Deviation, a statistical metric used to quantify how closely the actual leading digit distribution of a dataset follows Benford's Law.
🔍 Where MAD is used in the code:

mad = np.mean(np.abs(actual_rel_full - benford_dist))
print(f"  ➤ Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD): {mad:.4f}")

📐 What Does It Measure?

For each feature (e.g., 'sales_value', 'num_clients', etc.), the code:

    Computes the actual distribution of leading digits (as proportions).

    Compares it to the theoretical Benford's Law distribution.

    Takes the absolute difference for each digit (1 through 9).

    Averages those differences → that's the MAD.

📊 Formula:

Let:

    AiAi​ = Actual proportion for digit ii

    BiBi​ = Benford's expected proportion for digit ii

Then:
MAD=19∑i=19∣Ai−Bi∣
MAD=91​i=1∑9​∣Ai​−Bi​∣
✅ Interpretation:

    Low MAD (e.g., < 0.015) → actual distribution is very close to Benford's Law (often seen in forensic/accounting audits).

    High MAD → indicates a deviation from expected distribution, suggesting the data does not follow Benford's Law.

📌 Important in Context:

Since your data is randomly generated and small in size:

    MAD will likely be high, confirming that the dataset doesn't conform to Benford’s Law.

Let me know if you'd like to add thresholds (like Nigrini's guideline of 0.006 for close conformity).
