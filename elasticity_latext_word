For Microsoft Word, you can insert the elasticity formula using Equation Editor. Here’s how to do it:
🧾 Steps to Insert the Formula in Word:

    Go to Insert → Equation (or press Alt + =).

    Paste this into the equation box:

Elasticity = \frac{\% \Delta \text{Service Payments}}{\% \Delta \text{Customers}}

Word will render it as:
Elasticity=%ΔService Payments%ΔCustomers
Elasticity=%ΔCustomers%ΔService Payments​
ℹ️ Notes:

    \% renders the percent sign.

    \Delta gives the delta symbol (change).

    \text{} is used to insert readable text.
