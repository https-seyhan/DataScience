when either the percentage change in customers or service payments is zero, elasticity becomes undefined or mathematically unstable.
⚠️ When One Value is Zero
Scenario	Math Result	Business Interpretation
%ΔCustomers = 0 (denominator is zero)	❌ Division by zero (undefined)	Customer base didn’t change, but service cost did.
%ΔService Payments = 0 (numerator is zero)	✅ Elasticity = 0	No cost change despite customer growth — very efficient.
🔍 What to Do in Practice
Case	Suggested Handling
Denominator is zero	Mark as undefined or NaN; flag for review
Numerator is zero	Set elasticity to 0
Both are zero	Define elasticity as 0 or undefined, depending on context
💡 Business Insight

    If customers aren't growing but costs are, it might indicate:

        Manual service effort

        Fixed overheads scaling independently

        Poor automation

    If costs stay flat while customers grow, it’s often a sign of strong operational efficiency — scaling without extra expense.
