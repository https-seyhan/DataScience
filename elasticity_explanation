When both the percentage change in service payments and percentage change in customers are negative, the elasticity value becomes positive, because:
Negative % ChangeNegative % Change=Positive Number
Negative % ChangeNegative % Changeâ€‹=Positive Number
ðŸ“Œ What It Means:
Scenario	Elasticity Value	Interpretation
Both numerator and denominator are negative	Positive	Costs and customers are shrinking together â€” scaling down with similar intensity.
Numerator negative, denominator positive	Negative	Cost is dropping despite growth â€” possibly improved efficiency.
Numerator positive, denominator negative	Negative	Cost is rising despite losing customers â€” a serious inefficiency.
âœ… Summary:

A positive elasticity (even during decline) means costs and customer base are moving in sync.
But a negative elasticity means costs and customer growth are moving in opposite directions â€” a red flag that deserves investigation.
