CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is a widely-used, structured methodology for managing data science and analytics projects. It provides a framework of six phases that guide teams from business understanding to the deployment of a model, and it's designed to be industry-neutral, repeatable, and iterative.
üîÅ Overview of the 6 CRISP-DM Phases:

    Business Understanding

        Goal: Define the business problem clearly.

        Tasks:

            Understand project objectives and requirements.

            Translate business goals into data mining goals.

            Define success criteria (e.g., reduce churn by 15%).

    Data Understanding

        Goal: Explore and familiarize yourself with the data.

        Tasks:

            Collect initial data.

            Describe data structure (types, formats).

            Explore data (statistics, visualizations).

            Identify data quality issues or outliers.

    Data Preparation

        Goal: Prepare the final dataset for modeling.

        Tasks:

            Clean missing values and remove noise.

            Select relevant features.

            Create derived features (e.g., ratios, date differences).

            Transform data (normalization, encoding).

            Join data sources if needed.

    Modeling

        Goal: Build and evaluate various models.

        Tasks:

            Choose modeling techniques (e.g., decision tree, logistic regression).

            Train models on prepared data.

            Tune parameters (e.g., via grid search).

            Evaluate performance (accuracy, AUC, RMSE).

    Evaluation

        Goal: Assess the model from a business perspective.

        Tasks:

            Determine if the model meets business objectives.

            Validate the model with domain experts.

            Consider alternative models or improvements.

            Document final findings and recommendations.

    Deployment

        Goal: Make the model available for use.

        Tasks:

            Create reports, dashboards, or APIs.

            Integrate the model into business processes.

            Set up monitoring or retraining schedules.

            Provide user training and documentation.

üß† Key Characteristics:

    Iterative: You may revisit earlier phases (e.g., more data prep after modeling).

    Flexible: Supports both traditional and modern machine learning workflows.

    Business-Driven: Always ties back to the original business problem.

üìä Real-Life Example:

Goal: Predict customer churn for a telecom company.

    Business Understanding: Reduce churn rate to improve revenue.

    Data Understanding: Analyze customer demographics, usage, complaints.

    Data Preparation: Encode categorical data, fill missing usage stats.

    Modeling: Use logistic regression and random forest.

    Evaluation: Check if churn predictions are reliable and actionable.

    Deployment: Set up alerts for high-risk customers in a dashboard.
