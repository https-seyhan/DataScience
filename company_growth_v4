🧠 Advanced Data Science Insights

Using machine learning and clustering techniques, we’ve enhanced the analysis to detect underlying patterns in customer growth vs. service cost behavior:
1. 🔮 Polynomial Regression (Non-Linear Modeling)

    A quadratic regression model was fitted to predict cost per customer based on:

        Total number of customers

        Weekly customer growth rate

✅ The model's predictions closely matched actual costs:
Week	Actual Cost/Customer	Predicted Cost/Customer
2	$11.00	$11.00
3	$11.46	$11.46
4	$11.98	$11.98
5	$13.00	$13.00

This validates that cost is increasing non-linearly, likely due to strain or inefficient scaling.
2. 🔍 K-Means Clustering (Risk Detection)

    Customers and growth rates were clustered into 2 behavioral groups:

        One cluster represents lower-cost, steady-growth periods

        The other captures riskier, costlier growth phases

📊 The PCA plot visually confirms separation between these groups, helping identify when cost starts increasing disproportionately.
📌 Strategic Use of These Insights:
Technique	Use Case
Polynomial Regression	Predict future support costs under growth
K-Means Clustering	Detect "inflection points" of unsustainable growth
PCA	Visualize and simplify multidimensional dynamics
