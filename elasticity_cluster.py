/home/sandbox/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/seaborn/relational.py:658: UserWarning: You passed a edgecolor/edgecolors ('w') for an unfilled marker ('x').  Matplotlib is ignoring the edgecolor in favor of the facecolor.  This behavior may change in the future.

Output image

Here's your cluster interpretation plot:

    Each point = one week.

    Color = cluster group (based on service growth behavior).

    Axes = weekly % change in customers vs. service payments.

üîç Interpretation:

    Cluster 0 and Cluster 1 separate weeks with different scaling behavior.

    Weeks in the top-right are fast-growing in both customers and cost ‚Äî possibly expensive scaling.

    Weeks closer to the diagonal show balanced scaling.
