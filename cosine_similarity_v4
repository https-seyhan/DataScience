Why Use Cosine Similarity in Network Analysis?
1. Focuses on Direction, Not Magnitude

    Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors, not their length.

    Two nodes (e.g. organizations, users, documents) with proportional patterns will be seen as very similar, even if their absolute values are different.

✅ Example:
If Org A and Org B both prioritize revenue over employees and both have similar product/service distributions, they will be seen as similar — even if Org B is 10× larger.
2. Ideal for High-Dimensional Feature Vectors

    When nodes are described by many attributes (e.g., sales, clients, services, etc.), cosine similarity:

        Treats them as vectors in a multidimensional space

        Computes how "aligned" their behavior or structure is

✅ Useful for:

    Organizations, documents, users, etc., described by metrics or preferences

3. Builds Similarity-Based Networks

    In similarity networks, edges represent closeness or alignment between nodes.

    Cosine similarity provides a natural thresholding approach:

        Edges can be created only when similarity > 0.9, for example

        Edge weights can reflect degree of similarity

✅ Enables:

    Community detection (find groups with similar patterns)

    Centrality analysis (identify typical vs. outlier patterns)

    Role analysis (find peer-like nodes)

4. Insensitive to Scale Differences

    Two entities can be vastly different in size but still follow the same "strategy" or "pattern".

    Cosine similarity captures this nuance, unlike Euclidean distance, which punishes large magnitudes.

5. Works Well for Sparse or Skewed Data

    Especially common in document networks or user-preference graphs where:

        Vectors are sparse (e.g., many 0s)

        Some features dominate others (e.g., heavy-tailed distributions)

📌 In Summary:
Method	Sensitive to Scale?	Direction-Based?	Common Use
Cosine Similarity	❌ No	✅ Yes	Pattern/similarity networks
Euclidean Distance	✅ Yes	❌ No	Spatial/distance-based networks
