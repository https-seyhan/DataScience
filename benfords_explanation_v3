Python code performs two main analyses on randomly generated organizational data:

    Benford’s Law analysis on numerical features.

    Cosine similarity and network visualization between organizations based on standardized features.

🧩 Code Explanation
📦 1. Sample Data Generation

df = pd.DataFrame({...})

Creates a DataFrame with 10 organizations and five numerical features:

    'sales_value': Normally distributed around 10,000.

    'num_clients', 'num_employees', 'item_quantity', 'num_services': Random integers in specified ranges.

📐 2. Feature Normalization

X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df[features])

Standardizes the feature data (zero mean, unit variance) for cosine similarity analysis later.
📊 3. Benford’s Law Analysis
🔎 Function: leading_digit_distribution(data)

Extracts the first significant digit from each value and calculates:

    Relative frequencies

    Absolute frequencies

    Total valid count (non-zero, positive numbers)

📈 Expected Benford Distribution:

benford_dist = pd.Series({...})

Represents the theoretical frequencies for digits 1–9 under Benford’s Law.
⚙️ Loop Over Features:

for col in features:
    ...

For each feature:

    Extract leading digits

    Compare actual vs Benford distribution

    Plot the comparison

    Calculate MAD (Mean Absolute Deviation) from Benford

    Perform Chi-square goodness-of-fit test, if total counts match

🔄 4. Cosine Similarity Between Organizations

similarity = cosine_similarity(X_scaled)

Computes pairwise cosine similarity between organization rows based on scaled features.
Output: Prints similarity scores for each pair of organizations.
🌐 5. Network Graph of Similar Organizations

if sim > threshold:
    G.add_edge(orgs[i], orgs[j], weight=round(sim, 2))

    Edges are added for organization pairs with similarity > 0.4.

    If no edges, a message is printed.

    Otherwise, a network graph is drawn using NetworkX and Matplotlib.

📌 Does the Output Match Benford's Law?
➤ Probably Not, and Here's Why:

    Small Sample Size (n=10):

        Benford’s Law works best with large, naturally distributed datasets.

        With only 10 values per column, the distribution of leading digits is erratic.

    Randomly Generated Data:

        sales_value is normally distributed, not scale-invariant — violating assumptions of Benford’s Law.

        Other features (num_clients, etc.) are from uniform or limited ranges, which don’t follow Benford’s Law.

    Expected Outcome:

        High MAD values

        Low p-values (if counts match) → indicating deviation from Benford

        Plots will show poor fit to Benford’s curve

✅ Summary
Component	Purpose
leading_digit_distribution()	Extracts and counts leading digits
benford_dist	Theoretical Benford frequencies
MAD	Measures deviation from Benford’s law
chisquare()	Statistical test for goodness-of-fit
cosine_similarity()	Measures org similarity based on features
networkx graph	Visualizes similar orgs as a network
Final Insight: The code is structurally correct and performs both analyses. However, due to synthetic and small-scale data, the Benford analysis will almost certainly not match the law.
