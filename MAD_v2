In the code, MAD refers to Mean Absolute Deviation, a statistical metric used to quantify how closely the actual leading digit distribution of a dataset follows Benford's Law.
🔍 Where MAD is used in the code:

mad = np.mean(np.abs(actual_rel_full - benford_dist))
print(f"  ➤ Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD): {mad:.4f}")

📐 What Does It Measure?

For each feature (e.g., 'sales_value', 'num_clients', etc.), the code:

    Computes the actual distribution of leading digits (as proportions).

    Compares it to the theoretical Benford's Law distribution.

    Takes the absolute difference for each digit (1 through 9).

    Averages those differences → that's the MAD.

📊 Formula:

Let:

    AiAi​ = Actual proportion for digit ii

    BiBi​ = Benford's expected proportion for digit ii

Then:
MAD=19∑i=19∣Ai−Bi∣
MAD=91​i=1∑9​∣Ai​−Bi​∣
✅ Interpretation:

    Low MAD (e.g., < 0.015) → actual distribution is very close to Benford's Law (often seen in forensic/accounting audits).

    High MAD → indicates a deviation from expected distribution, suggesting the data does not follow Benford's Law.

📌 Important in Context:

Since your data is randomly generated and small in size:

    MAD will likely be high, confirming that the dataset doesn't conform to Benford’s Law.

the MAD values based on well-established guidelines, such as those suggested by Dr. Mark Nigrini, a leading expert on Benford’s Law.
✅ Step-by-step Change to Your Code:

Modify this part:

mad = np.mean(np.abs(actual_rel_full - benford_dist))
print(f"  ➤ Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD): {mad:.4f}")

To this:

mad = np.mean(np.abs(actual_rel_full - benford_dist))

# Interpretation thresholds (based on Nigrini)
if mad < 0.006:
    conformity = "✔️ Close conformity (likely Benford-compliant)"
elif mad < 0.012:
    conformity = "⚠️ Acceptable conformity (some deviation)"
elif mad < 0.015:
    conformity = "❗Marginal conformity (possible issue)"
else:
    conformity = "❌ Non-conforming (does not follow Benford's Law)"

print(f"  ➤ Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD): {mad:.4f} → {conformity}")

💡 What These Thresholds Mean:
MAD Range	Interpretation
< 0.006	✔️ Strong/close conformity
0.006 – 0.012	⚠️ Acceptable/possible conformity
0.012 – 0.015	❗Marginal conformity (questionable)
> 0.015	❌ Non-conforming (likely not Benford)

These thresholds are commonly used in fraud detection and data auditing.
