📌 Understanding Poisson Regression in This Model

    We are using Poisson regression to model the number of incidents (IncidentCount) based on text embeddings.
    The Poisson distribution is ideal for count data (non-negative integers like incident occurrences).
    The predicted count of incidents is then used to estimate probabilities of death per year.

📊 Poisson Regression Output

The output will look something like this (simplified):
TextFeature	RiskLevel	Severity	Priority	Predicted_Deaths	Death_Probability
Minor safety issue reported	Low	Minor	Low	1.2	0.05
Risk of falling objects is high	Medium	Moderate	Normal	4.5	0.18
Severe flooding at the site	High	Severe	Urgent	20.1	0.80
Some safety concerns raised	Medium	Moderate	Normal	3.8	0.15
Potential hazard identified	Medium	Severe	High	7.2	0.29
Low-impact site risk identified	Low	Minor	Low	0.8	0.03
Workers reported some risk	Medium	Moderate	Normal	2.0	0.08
Major accident risk detected	High	Severe	Urgent	19.0	0.76
Hazardous area spotted	High	Severe	High	15.5	0.62
Worksite safety moderate	Medium	Moderate	Normal	5.0	0.20
📌 Interpreting the Columns

    Predicted_Deaths → The Poisson regression model estimates the expected number of incidents per year.
        Example: "Severe flooding at the site" → 20.1 predicted deaths (high risk).
        Example: "Low-impact site risk identified" → 0.8 predicted deaths (low risk).

    Death_Probability → This is normalized to sum to 1 across all rows.
        This gives the relative probability of death for each scenario.

📌 How Poisson Regression Works

    Poisson regression assumes the log of the expected count is a linear function of the predictors:
    log⁡(E[Y])=β0+β1X1+β2X2+...+βnXn
    log(E[Y])=β0​+β1​X1​+β2​X2​+...+βn​Xn​
        E[Y] is the expected incident count.
        X_1, X_2, ..., X_n are SBERT text embeddings.
        The model exponentiates the output to predict the incident rate.

    This means:
        Higher-risk text embeddings lead to higher predicted incident counts.
        The final probability is derived from the relative proportions of incidents.

✅ Key Takeaways

✔ Poisson regression predicts expected incidents based on textual risk descriptions.
✔ Probability of death is assigned based on normalized incident counts.
✔ High-severity descriptions (e.g., "Major accident risk detected") result in higher predicted counts.
