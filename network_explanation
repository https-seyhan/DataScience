ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Sample Data Creation

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'organization': [f'Org_{i+1}' for i in range(10)],
    ...
})

What itâ€™s doing:

    It's creating a DataFrame with fake data for 10 organizations.

    Each org has 5 numeric metrics: sales_value, num_clients, num_employees, item_quantity, and num_services.

Why it matters for debugging:

    These values are randomly generated. So every run gives you different numbers, which can make debugging tricky unless you fix the random seed (e.g. np.random.seed(42)).

    Make sure the columns you plan to use later are actually in this DataFrame.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Normalize Metrics

features = ['sales_value', 'num_clients', 'num_employees', 'item_quantity', 'num_services']
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df[features])

What itâ€™s doing:

    Normalizes the feature columns using StandardScaler, which gives each column mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

Why this is important:

    Similarity calculations like cosine similarity are sensitive to scale. Without normalization, one large-scale metric (e.g., sales_value) could dominate the similarity score.

Debug tip:

    If things look weird later, you might want to print(X_scaled) and confirm it looks like a standardized matrix.

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Calculate Similarity

similarity = cosine_similarity(X_scaled)

What itâ€™s doing:

    Computes the cosine similarity between each pair of organizations based on the scaled metrics.

    This results in a 10x10 matrix where each entry [i][j] represents similarity between Org_i and Org_j.

Debug tip:

    Check similarity.shape is (10, 10).

    The diagonal should all be 1 (perfect self-similarity).

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Build Network Graph

G = nx.Graph()
...
threshold = 0.9

What itâ€™s doing:

    Builds a graph where each organization is a node.

    Adds edges between organizations only if their cosine similarity is greater than 0.9.

Why it might fail or behave unexpectedly:

    If 0.9 is too high, you might get very few or no edges.

    You can print(sim) in the loop to debug how many similarities pass the threshold.

    Try temporarily lowering the threshold (e.g., to 0.7) to test.

Debug tip:

    print(G.edges(data=True)) before the plot to see what connections you have.

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Visualize Network

pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)
...
nx.draw(...)

What itâ€™s doing:

    Lays out the graph in a nice 2D spring layout.

    Edge thickness is scaled by similarity.

    Labels are added for clarity.

Debugging visualization:

    If the graph looks empty or sparse, probably very few similarities exceeded 0.9.

    If nodes overlap or look off, adjusting node_size, layout, or adding plt.tight_layout() might help.

âœ… TL;DR Debug Checklist
Checkpoint	What to Look For
Step 1	Data randomness: Set seed for reproducibility.
Step 2	Confirm standardization with print(X_scaled)
Step 3	Print similarity matrix, confirm itâ€™s symmetric and diagonal = 1
Step 4	Is threshold too high? Lower it to test connectivity
Step 5	Use print(G.edges()) to check if graph is being built correctly
